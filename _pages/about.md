Hi👋, Paul there!

- I am a Data Engineer / Analyst. 

- 🔭 As a Data passionate, I enjoy automating and deploying web applications for Data Analysis.​

- 👨🏻‍💻 Last 3 years, I have worked on spatial analysis of seafloor data. I have built a Machine Learning based Methodology to automate seafloor geomorphologic mapping and provide statistical tools for reproducibility.

- ❤️ I also like to draw, write short narrative texts/poems, read, go for a run, travel to meet people and discover new places.
