Hi, welcome to my little corner of the web 🌍

I’m a Data Scientist with a passion for solving complex problems and turning data into stories.

🎓 I hold a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Biostatistics. My research focuses on contributing to the statistical analysis of geomorphological and spatial compositional data, with an application to studying coral reef communities.

If that sounds fancy, it’s because it is! 🚀

👨🏻‍💻 I’m all about automating workflows and building sleek, deployable tools for data analysis. There’s nothing more satisfying than creating tools that make complex tasks simple and scalable.

❤️ When I’m not crunching data, you’ll probably find me exploring my creative side! I love to draw, write short stories and poems, read books that expand my perspective, run to clear my mind, or travel to meet amazing people and discover breathtaking places.

 💃📊 Let’s connect, build cool things, and make data dance!
