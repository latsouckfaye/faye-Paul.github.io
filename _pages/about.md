Hi👋, welcome to my website.

I am a Data Engineer / Analyst. 

🔭 As a Data passionate, I enjoy automating and deploying web applications for Data Analysis.​

👨🏻‍💻  I received my Master of Science (MS) degree in [Applied Mathematics and Computer Science](https://sciences-technologies.univ-lille.fr/mathematiques/formation/master-mention-miashs) from the University of Lille(France). Last 3 years, I have worked on spatial analysis of seafloor data. I have built a Machine Learning based methodology to automate seafloor geomorphologic mapping and provide statistical tools for reproducibility.

❤️ I also like to draw, write short narrative texts/poems, read, go for a run, travel to meet people and discover new places.
